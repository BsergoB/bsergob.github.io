I’m a QA Engineer and Independent Contractor with several years of experience in software testing, test automation, 
and quality assurance for web and mobile applications. My professional journey began with a strong interest 
in understanding how software works under the hood — how small details in logic, performance, and usability can define the overall user experience. 
Over the years, I’ve developed a deep understanding of the full software development lifecycle (SDLC) and have worked with distributed teams to deliver stable, 
secure, and high-quality products for international clients. I focus on building structured, scalable QA processes that align with both business goals and technical requirements.

My expertise spans manual and automated testing, API validation, and integration testing using modern tools such as Postman, Playwright, Selenium, and Python-based frameworks. 
I’m proficient in Jira, Git, and CI/CD workflows, and I take pride in bridging communication between developers, product owners, and stakeholders 
to ensure that testing is an integral part of the development cycle rather than an afterthought. As an independent contractor, 
I manage my projects end-to-end — from requirements analysis to final delivery — while maintaining transparency, reliability, and accountability. 
I value continuous learning, adaptability, and precision in my work, striving to help teams achieve higher software quality and smoother releases.
